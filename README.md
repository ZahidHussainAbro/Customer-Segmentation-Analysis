In this project, total data is columns 5, rows 200, and big data can be used on high computational power.

K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition data into kkk distinct groups (clusters). It aims to minimize the variance within each cluster while maximizing the variance between clusters.

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗞-𝗠𝗲𝗮𝗻𝘀 𝗖𝗹𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴:
Centroid: A point in the feature space that represents the center of a cluster.
Distance Metric: Usually, the Euclidean distance is used to measure the distance between points and centroids.
Intra-cluster Distance: The distance between points within a cluster (minimized by K-means).
Inter-cluster Distance: The distance between centroids of different clusters (maximized indirectly).

𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹: We can see that by k means clustering data points customers spent are separated and grouped into clusters on similar data points or behavior using Annual Spend and their income level. It's robust to segment or spend on marketing campaigns or improve spending more on customers who purchase more and improve for customers who purchase less. This outcome gives powerful context to make productive and informed decisions.
